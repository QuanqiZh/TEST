For graph.c file

1. Change some funtions' name like line 19 in "graph.c" "fromStringtoGraph" to "from_file_to_graph", "showList" to "show_list", "dfsExploreVertexNodes" to "dfs_explore_vertexNodes".

2. For "graph.c" file, all global variable are eliminated and transformed into pointer. And all functions' input parameters are changed correspondingly. Like "from_file_to_graph", "dfs_explore_vertexNodes", 

3. Merge the function "analysis" and "output" into one function "analysis" 

For graph.h file

1. Change the function's name and input parameters accordingly.

For main.c file

1. Delele all global parameters.

2. Create more pointers to replace global variables. From line 46-55 you can see some are new pointers and they are allocated memory.

3. Add some free function for new pointers.

For pro1graph.c and pro1graph.h file

1. Change some functions name, eliminate global variables, change the input parameters like function  "graph_generate", "create_graph", "check_neighbors".

For pro1main.c file
1.In line 27,line 28, add some new pointer to replace global variables and allocate memory for them.
